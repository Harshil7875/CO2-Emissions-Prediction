# CO2 Emissions Prediction
This project is based on analysing various factors which lead to increase in CO2 emissions. A polynomial regression model has been created to predict which vehicle is prone to have a higher CO2 emission score based on factors in the dataset which include engine size, number of cyinders and average fuel consumption
